Personnel costs are by far the largest expense item. Our excellent team is our most important resource. In addition, non-personnel costs as well as tax payments are incurred every year. Most of the expenditure is project-related. We try to keep the administrative costs of the organization low (approx. 5% of the total expenditure). They include, for example, material costs for rent, finances, insurances and technical infrastructure.

This year, OKF employs an average of 28 people, many of them part-time. 3 team members do not work in Berlin, but are located in the Jugend hackt Labs in the cities FÃ¼rstenberg and Ulm. We are very pleased that the share of female employees at OKF is more than 55%.
